About
================

Greenpeace Greenwire is an international platform for the greenpeace volunteer community.
Check it out: https://greenwire.greenpeace.org

This repository serves as a styleguide for the redesign of the notifications that are
send when an activity is happening on the platform. Some examples of notifications:
- Someone commented on an article you wrote
- Someone invited you to join an event
- Someone mentioned you in a shout
- Etc.

How to get started
===================

You'll need npm and grunt to inline the CSS. Indeed you can't use a spreadsheet in emails,
but it doesn't mean your code needs to be all over the place.

```
npm install --dev
grunt
```

You'll find the email templates ready to use in /build
